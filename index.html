    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites or web applications for the internet. It encompasses several aspects, including web design, front-end and back-end development, content management, and database management. Front-end development focuses on what users interact with directly, involving languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, visually appealing interfaces. Back-end development, on the other hand, handles the server-side logic, databases, and APIs, often using languages like Python, Node.js, or PHP. Web development also includes ensuring website functionality, security, and optimization for performance across different devices. It plays a crucial role in delivering dynamic, user-centric experiences and is essential for businesses, organizations, and individuals aiming to establish a strong online presence.</p>
